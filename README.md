This repository contains the analysis code originally written in a Jupyter Notebook for the study:

**"Analysis of the Impact of Weather Conditions on Flight Delays at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) During 2013–2023"**, intended for submission to *International Journal of Climatology*.

## 📄 Description

This project analyzes meteorological data and flight delay patterns using Python. It applies regression techniques and seasonal analysis based on 10 years of flight and weather data.

## 📁 Contents

- `scripts/code_paper_converted.py`: Auto-generated script from the original Jupyter Notebook.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `figures/`: (Optional) Output plots from the analysis.
